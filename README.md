# Potato Leaf Classification Project using convolutional neural network (CNN)

## Overview

This project is mainly focused on classifying potato leaves from other objects. The primary goal is to develop a model that accurately identifies potato leaves, which will serve as a foundational step for subsequent models. The next stage involves predicting potato leaves into three distinct classes:

- **Potato Leaf Blight**
- **Potato Early Blight**
- **Potato Healthy**

## Project Structure

- **api/**:  Contain main.py to test th project
- **saved_models/**: Saved models and scripts for model architecture.
- **traning/**: contain the dataset and notbook file 
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies needed to run the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Getch-27/CNN_potato-leaf-binary-classifier.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
